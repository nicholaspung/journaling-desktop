# Project management

## TODOS

- Change questions so that if I answer a question, it shows that question and answer, not another random question
- Disable "New question" button if I already answered for the day
- Add a way to add more questions
- Start changing the structure of the project folder to be a little more maintainable
- Add different routes to the application and place the components there
- Figure out if Claude can help me change the complete styling of the shadcn components to look a little nicer
- See if there's a way to generate a "SDK" for the Wails bindings after they are created
- See if there's a way to generate types from the Go backend models in Typescript
- See if there's a way to choose the database it loads
- For questions, if there's a history, add a button that allows for comparison view between today's question, and the selected question
